# Retail Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on developing a machine learning system that predicts retail sales based on historical data, seasonal trends, and store-specific factors. Accurate sales prediction enables retailers to optimize inventory, plan staffing, prevent stockouts, manage supply chains efficiently, and make data-driven business decisions.

The system uses techniques such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression-based machine learning models to forecast sales for different stores and products. The project demonstrates how predictive analytics can support real-world retail operations and improve business performance.
